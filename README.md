# IndividualMiniProject

As of right now, in order to run this project the user must open the application.
Once the application is opened they will appear on a screen with a button labeled "LOAD IMAGE".
Once the user clicks the "LOAD IMAGE" button they will be taken to their Android Phone's gallary.
In the Android gallary they will be allowed to select an image.
Once an image is selected they can load it into the application.
After the image is loaded a random text will appear along with the path to the file chosen.
